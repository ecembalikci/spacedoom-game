# spacedoom-game
a basic multiplayer 2d platform game which is developed with Photon Bolt.

Before starting the game, you choose to create or join to a game. If there is no room to join, the game will be empty. After starting the game with another gamer you'll have your own spaceship to doom your enemy via shooting at their spaceship. With Bolt being a pretty new technology, in the development process, it was hard to find a resource to learn since they're so limited, that's the reason why the game has the basics only.
